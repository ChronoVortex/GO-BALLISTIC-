<![CDATA[ This mod adds several sets of ballistic weapons and drones to the game, including autocannons, gauss, coil guns and railguns, all with unique animations and sounds.

You can also use “ranged weapons” to try to deal a first strike against an enemy, shoot down an incoming threat, and do lots of other things ranged weapons are useful for.

If you want to see if a weapon is ranged, check its tip in the equipment tab.
